# `TinyTiny RSS as a systemd portable service`

Build an immutable [Tiny Tiny RSS](https://tt-rss.org/) image for a systemd [portable service](https://systemd.io/PORTABLE_SERVICES/).
Made with uwsgi and nixos.

## Quick Start

Get the latest image from a [Github release](https://github.com/gdamjan/tt-rss-service/releases/), into
`/var/lib/portables` and then run:

```sh
portablectl attach --enable --now tt-rss
```

The service **has** to be configured in the `/etc/tt-rss/config.env` file before it's started, see bellow.
All state will be kept in `/var/lib/private/tt-rss`.

The running service is available via the `/run/tt-rss.sock` uwsgi
socket that can be used in nginx.

## Application configuration

The service is configured by the `/etc/tt-rss/config.php` file (make sure it's mode 644, ie readable by the service),
copy/paste the following snippet, and edit to your liking:

Example:
```
<?php
    define('DB_TYPE', 'mysql'); // pgsql or mysql
    define('DB_HOST', 'localhost');
    define('DB_NAME', 'ttrss');
    define('DB_USER', 'tt-rss');
    define('DB_PASS', 'tt-rss');
    define('DB_PORT', '3306');
    define('SELF_URL_PATH', 'http://localhost:8080/');
```

## Nginx configuration

The portable service will operate on the `/run/tt-rss.sock` uwsgi socket. We gonna let the host nginx handle
all the http, https and letsencrypt work. The config is simple, just proxy everything back to the uwsgi socket:
```
server {
    …
    location / {
        include uwsgi_params;
        uwsgi_pass unix:/run/tt-rss.sock;
    }
    …
}
```
> Note: even static files are served by the uwsgi server, but uwsgi has a good enough static files server, which doesn't
> block the application workers
